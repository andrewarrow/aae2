- The reason the HTML doesn't look right yet is because there are CSS
- images
- and js files not in the right path yet

- we'll just add /assets in front of them all and
- cp -r over the directories and
- now it looks right 

002

- Lets remove the stock content and start making this our website
- Looking good, but our /about-us page doesn't match

003

- We need a way to make any page, look like this first index.tmpl
- Lets take the top of it, and place it in a _header file
- with define header at top, and end at the end
- back in index.tmpl lets insert this template at the top
- back in main.go lets make AboutUs more like WelcomeIndex
- copy index.tmpl to a new about_us.tmpl
- change the content
- and /about-us looks great
